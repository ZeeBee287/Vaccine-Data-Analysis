ML Model Selection

Model Selection depends on the type of vaccine, the transaction period of the data, any missing values in the dataset etc.
My dataset is small and inconsistent, hence it will have high RMSE values so I will use MAPE to deduce how well my ML model works.

MAPE values:
20%-50%: Reasonable Forecasting Model
10%-20%: Good Forecasting Model
<10%: Very Good Forecasting Model (Target)

Based on my dataset, I'll be using:
1) SARIMAX Model
2) Prophet Model
3) XGBoost Model

Let's go! and good luck to me :(
