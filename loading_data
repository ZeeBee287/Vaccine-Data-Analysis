# LOADING DATA


#1) Uploading .csv file

#Import Libraries and Upload the File
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from google.colab import files

# Upload the file
print("Please upload your CSV file:")
uploaded = files.upload()

# Replace '.csv' with the name of your uploaded file
file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]  # Get the uploaded file name dynamically
data = pd.read_csv(file_name)


#2) Preprocessing the Data

# Convert transaction_month to datetime format
data['transaction_month'] = pd.to_datetime(data['transaction_month'], format='%Y-%m')

# Aggregate Data for District and Tehsil Trends
# Group data by month, district, and tehsil
# Column names: dist_name,	tehsil_name,	transaction_month and,	total_quantity in .csv file
grouped_data = data.groupby(['transaction_month', 'dist_name', 'tehsil_name'])['total_quantity'].sum().reset_index()
